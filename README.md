## Project Description:
A shipping company has to send a set of orders over a transportation network, represented as a
undirected graph where each edge as a unit transportation cost and a maximum capacity (total
amount of goods that can travel along that edge in each direction). Each order is represented by a
given amount of goods, a starting node and an ending node. Because there is a certain chance that
edge of the network may fail (due to accidents, strikes, â€¦), each order have to be routed along two
separate edge-disjoint paths in the network, such that any one of them carries at least 40% (and
therefore no more than 60%) of the total amount of the order. The problem is to find a minimum cost set of (pairs of) paths with the required property that allow to satisfy all the orders while
satisfying the edge capacity constraints.
